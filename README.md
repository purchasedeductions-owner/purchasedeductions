# Purchase Deductions

Purchase Deductions is an AI-powered tool that analyzes Amazon purchases and helps businesses identify which expenses may be tax-deductible.

Managing Amazon expenses at scale is messy. Receipts are inconsistent, categories are unclear, and determining deductibility often requires manual review. Purchase Deductions is designed to automate this process and reduce the time and effort required to review business purchases.
